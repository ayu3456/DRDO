# DRDO
We will be working on the Project in which we will be implementing Visual Odometry. The purpose of this project is to create a prototype of a robot that has a camera embedded on it, to develop a robotic platform that can map its environment, determine its location, and detect obstacles in real time. The goal is to build a prototype of a robot with an embedded camera that can navigate autonomously based on visual inputs.
